# Portfolio site
A site for showcasing my previous projects, interests, and coding languages I have used previously. </br>

## React, TypeScript, Vite, Threejs
On this project as a new addition I utilize Threejs and React-three-fiber to use it with React to have 3D models and effects on the site. </br>
